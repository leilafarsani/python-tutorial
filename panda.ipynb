    "### Panda\n",
    "In Python, pandas is an open-source library that provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools. Here's a more detailed definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Structures: Pandas introduces two primary new data structures to Python â€“ DataFrame and Series. A DataFrame is a two-dimensional, size-mutable, potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns). A Series is a one-dimensional array-like object containing a sequence of values and associated array of data labels, called its index.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Functionality: The library includes functions for reading, writing, and manipulating data; handling missing data; filtering data; and performing data aggregation, among other operations. It can handle data from a variety of formats such as CSV, Excel, SQL databases, and JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use Cases: Pandas is widely used in various fields of data analysis, including finance, economics, statistics, advertising, Web analytics, and more. It is particularly suited for structured data operations and manipulations without needing to revert to more domain-specific languages like SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pandas is part of the larger ecosystem of Python libraries used for scientific computing, which includes libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib. It integrates well with these libraries, enabling users to perform comprehensive data analysis workflows with ease."

    "Pandas is an open source library, providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for Python. Sounds promising!\n",
    "\n",
    "The DataFrame is one of Pandas' most important data structures. It's basically a way to store tabular data where you can label the rows and the columns. One way to build a DataFrame is from a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the exercises that follow you will be working with vehicle data from different countries. Each observation corresponds to a country and the columns give information about the number of vehicles per capita, whether people drive left or right, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three lists are defined in the script:\n",
    "\n",
    "names, containing the country names for which data is available.\n",
    "dr, a list with booleans that tells whether people drive left or right in the corresponding country.\n",
    "cpc, the number of motor vehicles per 1000 people in the corresponding country.\n",
    "Each dictionary key is a column label and each value is a list which contains the column elements."
